# Introduction

Higgins is a framework for building OLTP processing pipelines that are:

- Easy to develop and operate
- Cost effective
- Ease the burden of communicating the structure of large programs between team members.

Higgins was born out of a frustration with current tooling when it comes to both streaming platforms and
processing frameworks. These tools generally being:

- Difficult or expensive to operate.
- Hard to develop without a very niche set of skills.
- Difficult for team members with disparate skillsets to reason about.

amongst other reasonings. Although higgins doesn't claim to solve all of these problems nor any of them, it is rather an attempt at
solving them through design choices.

If you have taken higgins for a test or generally think the project has some potential, please get in touch and give us your feedback!
